  <h3>Front-End Web Development</h3>
  <p>React + TypeScript + Tailwind seems perfect to me. Next.js if necessary.<br>I will soon learn Angular. Which will I prefer then?</p>
</li>
  <li style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
  <h3>Back-End Web Development</h3>
  <p>Java is my first choice for back-end development although I have some experience working with Django and Node. I've been working with JDBC recently. So cool.</p>
</li>
<li style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
  <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
  <p>I took an AWS-based elective on Cloud Computing which was pretty cool. My only non-academic experience so far is with Firebase, but I intend to make a project to host on AWS by the end of the year.</p>
</li>
<li style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
  <h3>Embedded Systems</h3>
  <p>I used C and C++ a lot in college. Maybe I'll use C++ for game development or C for embedded systems.</p>
</li>
  <li style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
  <h3>Mobile Apps</h3>
  <p>I did some Swift + SwiftUI work soon after I graduated. I'm not a huge fan of Swift, but I love Apple devices. I have plenty of apps I'd like to build for my watch.</p>
