  <h3>Web Development</h3>
  <p>At the start of this summer I spent a lot of time working with React, JavaScript, and CSS because I didn't learn about web development in school, but I am drawn toward Web Development and Software Engineering.<br>More recently, I have also been using TypeScript, Next.js, and TailwindCSS. I don't have much experience with Tailwind yet, but I am totally on-board with its design principles.</p>

  <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
  <p>I took a very interesting elective course on Cloud Computing in my final semester of College. This included a review of Networking; exposure to different cloud computing components like VPC, Subnets, Load Balancer; and explored architecture and scalability choices for distributed systems.</p>
